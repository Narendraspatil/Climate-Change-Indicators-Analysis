# **Unraveling Climate Change: A Comprehensive Analysis of Climate Indicators**

**Project Overview:**

This project involved an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and time series analysis of climate change indicators from 1961 to 2022. The dataset, sourced from international organizations, included key metrics such as surface temperature, atmospheric CO2 levels, mean sea levels, and ocean heat content. Our goal was to uncover trends, identify highly impacted regions, and understand the interplay between these indicators. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series analysis, trend detection, and forecasting using ARIMA models.

**Project Statement:**

Understanding the impact of climate change on global temperature and related indicators is crucial for formulating effective mitigation strategies. This project aims to identify trends and correlations between various climate indicators to provide actionable insights for policy makers and researchers.

**Project Objectives:**

- Data Distribution Analysis: Analyze the distribution of temperature changes and other indicators.
- Trend Analysis: Identify and visualize trends in temperature change and other climate indicators over time.
- Correlation Analysis: Examine the relationships between temperature change and other climate indicators such as atmospheric CO2 levels and mean sea levels.
- Regional Analysis: Assess temperature changes across different continents and identify regions with significant changes.
- Time Series Analysis and Forecasting: Apply ARIMA models to forecast future temperature changes and identify significant change points.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Python**: Utilized for initial data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and generating insights through statistical analysis and visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook and VS coder**: As an interactive environment for coding and documenting the analysis process.
- **Excel**: For initial data understanding and basic data cleaning (although the large dataset required transitioning to Python for efficiency).
- **Tableau**: Planned for creating interactive and easy-to-understand dashboards to visualize the key insights and findings from the EDA.
- **SQL**: To be integrated for advanced data querying and manipulation as part of a potential extension to the project.

**Key Insights:**

- Average Temperature Change: Significant increase from 1961 to 2022, with a pronounced upward trend since the 1980s.
- Regional Analysis: Europe and Northern Asia are experiencing the most rapid warming. The highest average temperature change was recorded in Russia.
- Trend Analysis of CO2 Levels: Linear growth in atmospheric CO2 levels, from 340 ppm in 1980 to over 415 ppm in 2022.
- Sea Level Rise: Consistent increase in mean sea levels, from -175 mm in 1880 to over 60 mm in 2022.
- Correlation: Strong correlation between temperature changes and atmospheric CO2 levels, indicating interconnected effects.

**Key Findings:**

- Rapid Temperature Increase Post-1990: Significant growth in global temperatures, with reduced variability since 2000.
- Europe and Northern Asia Hotspots: These regions show the highest temperature changes, highlighting the need for targeted climate policies.
- Strong Indicator Correlation: Temperature change closely linked with atmospheric CO2 levels and sea levels, reinforcing the interconnected nature of climate factors.

**Visualizations:**

The project includes comprehensive visualizations created using Tableau to illustrate the findings:
- Regional Analysis of Temperature Change: Map visualization showing temperature changes by region.
- Temperature Change Over the Years by Continent: Line graphs depicting temperature trends for different continents.
- Correlation Between Climate Indicators: Scatter plots and trend lines showing correlations between temperature change, CO2 levels, and sea levels.
